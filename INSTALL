The axiom project is built using maven2, and requires Java >= 1.5 to compile. In
order to run the jtestr tests on os-x, it is necessary to use Java 1.6. 
I've therefore made this the default source and JDK level in the pom
build section.

Install:

You should be able to accomplish this by running the command:

    $ mvn clean install

Note that you may need to edit your personal ~/.m2/settings.xml file in order to
access some of the repositories in which dependencies are being installed. 

Testing:

Some of the unit/integration tests for axiom are written using the jtestr test
library, which in turn uses jruby. The startup time for this can be very slow,
therefore to mitigate this problem, you can launch a background server to host
the jruby runtime and act as a sandbox for running the tests. To do so, you run
the following command:

    $ mvn org.jtestr:jtestr:server

Notes:

Installing on OSX

There are some *special* problems when installing on OSX, not the least of which 
is that Java 1.6 is still not the default JDK on Leopard, therefore you should 
probably take some additional steps to ensure that both maven and its plugins
use the correct JDK (1.6).

One way to do this is by exporting the following environment variables into the 
bash session in which you're launching maven:

export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home
export JAVA_VERSION=1.6

If you're trying to run maven from within an IDE, then look at the configuration 
settings to see if you can control the environment in this (or in some other) way.
